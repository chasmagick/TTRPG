Erick died protecting Baldwin and asked him to care for his sister Astrid and Ingrid, whom he secretly loved. The sisters escaped the island, arriving on the Sword Coast, eventually traveling to Elysium under the care of Artemis. Baldwin, surviving a deadly voyage, has spent a year trying to reunite with them on the island. Ingrid, formerly Chaotic Good, shifted to Chaotic Neutral due to emotional trauma and the influence of unsavory figures. Promoted from NPC to PC, she is scheduled to reunite with her siblings in an upcoming session."
